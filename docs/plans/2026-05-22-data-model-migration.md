# Data-model migration plan — current → target

**Role:** This plan sequences the migration described in `docs/plans/2026-05-21-data-model-target.md`. It follows an additive + re-publish + final-cleanup shape. The pipeline (`bun scripts/publish-approved-content.ts <N>`) is the authoritative writer; the DB is a projection of canonical staging files, not a source of truth. SQL-level backfills are not used for content tables.

**What this doc is not:** A schema reference. All DDL for new typed tables lives in `docs/plans/2026-05-21-data-model-target.md`. This plan governs sequencing, the writer/reader/validator triangle per PR, gating, and rollback.

> **⚠ Superseded in part by ADR 0011 (accepted 2026-05-25) — capability source-of-truth.**
> This plan (written 2026-05-22) assumes one regime for *all* content: "the DB is a projection of canonical staging files; the pipeline reads staging and re-publish overwrites." **ADR 0011 splits that:** it holds for **lesson content**, but **capability content is now DB-authoritative after seeding** — the Capability Stage reads lesson content *from the DB* (not staging files), seeds idempotently, and never overwrites seeded capabilities on a routine re-publish.
>
> **Consequences for this plan:**
> - **PRs 0–4 (capability side, ✅ shipped)** were built under the pre-ADR-0011 model (e.g. PR 1 writes distractors *from `vocab-enrichments.ts`*; PR 4 writes grammar *from staging candidates*). They stand as historical record, but their "capability stage reads staging" premise is **superseded** — the capability-stage redesign (epic #98, and `docs/adr/0011-...`) re-points those reads at the DB.
> - **PRs 5–6 (typed `lesson_sections` / `lesson_blocks`, not started)** are now **dual-purpose**: they remain the lesson *reader's* typed source, **and** they become the **capability-stage contract** — the typed lesson-content tables the Capability Stage reads (per CONTEXT.md → Stage Contract). They must land *before* the capability-stage redesign consumes them.
> - The capability-stage redesign (#98/#99) is **not** a separate-but-equal program; it re-founds the capability side on ADR 0011. Sequence it *after* the lesson-content typed tables exist.
>
> See `docs/adr/0011-capability-content-is-db-authoritative-after-seeding.md` and `CLAUDE.md` § Content Management → "Two source-of-truth regimes (ADR 0011)".

## §1. Fundamental model: the DB is a projection

Content tables (`learning_items`, `learning_capabilities`, `capability_artifacts`, `lesson_sections`, etc.) are fully regenerable by running `bun scripts/publish-approved-content.ts <N>` across all 9 lessons. The canonical source is `scripts/data/staging/lesson-N/` + `scripts/data/lessons.ts`.

**Migration strategy for Category A (regenerable content):**
1. Add new typed tables and columns to `scripts/migration.sql` (additive DDL only — no drops yet).
2. Update the pipeline writer (projector), validator, and reader for the target source_kind.
3. Re-publish all lessons — the pipeline populates the new shape from canonical staging files.
4. Final cleanup PR drops everything no longer read, once all readers have switched.

**Migration strategy for Category B (user state — precious):**
- `profiles`, `user_roles`, `learner_capability_state`, `learner_lesson_activation`, `capability_review_events`, `learning_sessions`, `error_logs` — preserve. No drops, no renames, no migrations of learner rows.

### §1.1 Capability ID stability across re-publish

**Finding (verified against `scripts/lib/pipeline/capability-stage/adapter.ts:116-146`):** `upsertCapabilities` upserts on `onConflict: 'canonical_key'` and returns the existing `id`. UUIDs in `learning_capabilities` are stable across re-publishes. A re-publish updates the row in place; the PK never changes.

**Consequence:** `learner_capability_state` and `capability_review_events` rows referencing `learning_capabilities.id` survive the migration unchanged. No canonical_key bridge step is needed.

### §1.2 The 7 pipeline gates

Every per-source-kind PR must pass all 7 gates before merging:

| Gate | What it proves |
|---|---|
| **G1 — Ingestion** | Staging files for the target source_kind exist and have the required shape. |
| **G2 — Authoring** | Staging file shape is valid under the new typed-column contracts. |
| **G3 — Lesson-stage publish** | Stage A runs clean; lesson + sections + audio_clips write correctly. |
| **G4 — Capability-stage publish** | Stage B runs clean; the typed satellite for the target source_kind has rows; `check-supabase-deep` no-orphan check passes. |
| **G5 — Activation** | `set_lesson_activation` RPC activates the lesson; `learner_lesson_activation` row exists. |
| **G6 — Session build** | `buildSession` returns capabilities of the target source_kind; planner's `validateCapability` returns `ready`. |
| **G7 — Learning** | Render → answer → `capability_review_events` row lands with `source_kind = '<target>'`. This is the definition-of-done anchor. |

**G7 is deterministic, not 48h-wait (decision Q4):** immediately after deploy + re-publish, the `?force_capability=<canonical_key>` bypass (built in PR 0, §3.8) drives one card through the full chain and queries `capability_review_events`. At 2-user scale, a 48h wait produces false negatives ("broken" vs "nobody logged in" are indistinguishable). The bypass-driven check is structurally equivalent and eliminates the noise.

### §1.3 Capability ordering — tracer bullet first

1. **`item` (PR 1)** — simplest source_kind; 3,900 caps already rendering. Proves the pattern.
2. **`dialogue_line` (PR 2)** — multi-line context, audio refs, L1 translation. 7 caps.
3. **`affixed_form_pair` (PR 3)** — morphology; 2 caps per linguistic pair. 4 caps.
4. **`pattern` (PR 4)** — most complex: 4 new typed exercise tables, routing widening in `renderContracts.ts`, first-ever live grammar exercises. 94 caps.

### §1.4 Per-PR template

Every source_kind PR (PRs 1–4) fills in these items:

```
1. DDL (additive only — no drops)
   - New typed table(s): CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS with all columns, PKs, FKs, UNIQUEs.
   - RLS: ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY.
   - Policies: DROP POLICY IF EXISTS; CREATE POLICY (per CLAUDE.md — no bulk-drop).
   - Grants: GRANT SELECT TO authenticated; REVOKE INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE FROM authenticated;
             GRANT ALL TO service_role.
   - COMMENT ON: every table + non-obvious column.
   - FK indexes: CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS on every FK column.
   - All DDL idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS guards, per-policy DROP IF EXISTS; CREATE).

2. Pipeline writer (projector)
   - File: scripts/lib/pipeline/capability-stage/projectors/<source_kind>.ts
   - Writes the new typed satellite rows.
   - OLD capability_artifacts writes are removed in the same PR (no dual-write needed —
     the re-publish IS the migration; there is no live reader on the old path during deploy).

3. Pre-write validator
   - File: scripts/lib/pipeline/capability-stage/validators/<source_kind>.ts
   - Enforces column names, types, required-vs-optional match with the typed table.
   - Fails CRITICAL (aborts publish) on missing required fields.

4. Reader rewrite (fail-loud — §1.5)
   - File: src/lib/exercise-content/byKind/<source_kind>.ts (or byType/<exercise_type>.ts)
   - Reads from the new typed table; throws CapabilityDataMissingError on empty result.
   - Old fetchArtifacts call sites removed in the same PR.

5. Re-publish + one-shot bridge
   - bun scripts/publish-approved-content.ts <N> in a per-lesson loop for all affected lessons.
   - **Lesson learned from PR 1 (see feedback_post_pr_verification + project_pr1_6_data_completion):** re-publish ONLY exercises currently-publishable lessons. Lessons blocked by lint-staging CRITICAL findings (e.g. cloze gaps) do NOT get their rows rewritten. Lessons that nobody re-publishes also stay stale. The pipeline-is-writer principle (ongoing) still holds — but for a SHAPE-TRANSITION PR, a one-shot bridge SQL is required to migrate existing rows whose lessons aren't being touched by this PR's re-publish.
   - Ship the bridge script in the SAME PR as the writer+reader: `scripts/migrate-<source_kind>-typed-tables.ts`. Idempotent, reports before/after counts.
   - "No SQL UPDATE backfill" remains the rule for the steady state. Bridge migrations are one-time shape transitions, not ongoing writes.

6. E2E test (§1.6 pattern)
   - e2e/<source_kind>.spec.ts using the ?force_capability bypass.
   - Written before schema/pipeline changes; confirmed to fail on old schema (TDD guard).

7. Health check additions
   - scripts/check-supabase-deep.ts: add the no-orphan query for this source_kind (§1.7).

8. Rollback
   - Revert the writer and reader code; re-publish on old code path.
   - Old capability_artifacts rows are gone — but the old projector can regenerate them
     on re-publish if the revert restores the artifact-write code path.
   - No schema rollback needed for additive DDL (new tables are inert if nothing reads them).

9. Post-merge verification (MANDATORY — see §1.8 — runs AFTER merge to main, BEFORE the next PR's prompt is dispatched)
   - Plan-vs-actual diff check: `git show <merge-commit> --stat`; cross-reference every file
     the PR section named. Smell-test if file counts feel light vs the PR's stated scope.
   - Live-DB completeness queries: parameterized SQL per source_kind (§1.8). Every cap of
     this source_kind MUST have its expected typed-table data populated, not just the
     bypass-tested example.
   - If either check fails: fix-forward in the same PR. Do NOT mark the PR done.
```

### §1.5 Fail-loud policy

From PR 1 forward, the pipeline and runtime **fail loudly** rather than silently skipping:

- **Reader rule:** every typed-table read that returns empty when `learning_capabilities` says the cap is ready → throw `CapabilityDataMissingError`. Do not return `null`; do not fall back silently.
- **Writer rule:** every projector that tries to write a typed table row without a required column → DB `NOT NULL` catches it at write time. The pre-write validator catches it before reaching the DB.
- **Validator rule:** every pre-write validator that finds a missing required field → CRITICAL finding that aborts the publish.

This is the direct cure for the dialogue-cloze silent-skip incident.

### §1.6 E2E test pattern (bypass-driven)

Every PR's E2E test uses the `?force_capability=<canonical_key>` bypass rather than a real session deck:

```ts
// e2e/<source_kind>.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
import { bypassSupabaseCors, login } from './_helpers'

const TARGET_CAP_KEY = '<canonical_key>'
const TARGET_SOURCE_KIND = '<source_kind>'

test('<source_kind>: bypass → answer → G7 row lands', async ({ page }) => {
  await bypassSupabaseCors(page)
  await login(page, { admin: true })
  const start = new Date().toISOString()
  await page.goto(`/session?force_capability=${encodeURIComponent(TARGET_CAP_KEY)}`)
  await page.locator('[data-exercise-type]').waitFor()
  await submitAnswer(page, '<correct-or-wrong>')
  const { data } = await sb.schema('indonesian')
    .from('capability_review_events')
    .select('capability_id, learning_capabilities!inner(source_kind)')
    .gte('created_at', start)
  expect(data.some(r => r.learning_capabilities.source_kind === TARGET_SOURCE_KIND)).toBe(true)
})
```

The `_helpers.ts` module is extracted in PR 0 from `e2e/session.spec.ts:9-44`. Kong allows only `.duin.home` origins; the CORS-bypass shim is required for Playwright on `localhost:5175`.

### §1.7 No-orphan invariant

After each typed table lands, `scripts/check-supabase-deep.ts` gains:

```ts
// Every capability of source_kind X has exactly one row in <typed_table>.
SELECT c.canonical_key
FROM indonesian.learning_capabilities c
LEFT JOIN indonesian.<typed_table> t ON t.capability_id = c.id
WHERE c.source_kind = '<source_kind>'
  AND t.id IS NULL
LIMIT 5
-- Expect: zero rows.
```

For grammar exercise tables (FK is `grammar_pattern_id` not `capability_id`): join via `learning_capabilities.source_ref → grammar_patterns.slug → <typed_table>.grammar_pattern_id`.

### §1.8 Post-merge verification (orchestrator-side, MANDATORY)

**Why this section exists:** PR 1 of this migration shipped a broken state and was declared done despite leaving 41% of `learning_items.translation_nl` unpopulated. Three architect rounds + one data-architect audit + a green G7 bypass check all missed it. The bug class — *data-completeness gaps that pass schema checks* — is invisible to plan reviewers because their catalogs cover plan correctness, not implementation correctness. The fix is two ground-truth checks the orchestrator runs after every PR merges, **before** the next PR's prompt is dispatched. See memory `feedback_post_pr_verification.md` and openbrain deployment-lesson `2bc57e23-f68d-44af-a729-552aac40d847`.

**Check 1 — Plan-vs-actual diff.** Verify the actually-merged commit's diff matches what this PR section claimed to implement.

```bash
git show <merge-commit-hash> --stat
git log --first-parent <previous-tip>..<merge-commit-hash> --oneline
```

Cross-reference every file the PR section names against the diff:
- Every file in the plan must appear in the diff (otherwise the implementation skipped the spec).
- Every file in the diff that is NOT in the plan is scope creep — flag it.
- If file counts feel light vs the PR's stated scope (PR claims "vertical pipeline slice" but only 3 lines changed in the writer), that is a critical smell — read the actual code, do NOT trust the dev's summary.

**Check 2 — Live-DB completeness queries.** Don't trust "G7 cleared on one bypass call." Query the actual tables for the invariants the plan promised. Per-source-kind templates (orchestrator parameterizes at PR-end time):

```sql
-- Template A: typed-column population on upstream table (PR 1 pattern)
-- IMPORTANT (lesson from PR 1.6): scope the query to publishable items only.
-- Rows in lessons blocked by lint-staging CRITICAL findings (e.g. dialogue-cloze
-- gaps in L5/7/8) legitimately stay NULL until their authoring gaps close.
-- Use item_type filtering or join to lessons to exclude known un-publishable scope.
SELECT
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE translation_nl IS NULL) AS missing_translation_nl,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE translation_en IS NULL) AS missing_translation_en
FROM indonesian.learning_items
WHERE item_type != 'dialogue_chunk';  -- dialogue chunks deferred until PR 3
-- Expect: 0 / 0 after the migration's bridge runs.
-- Non-zero = the bridge missed rows OR the projector failed for re-published lessons.

-- Template B: typed-table satellite parity (PR 1 + future PRs)
SELECT
  (SELECT count(*) FROM indonesian.capability_audio_refs)                      AS new_audio_refs,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM indonesian.capability_artifacts
    WHERE artifact_kind='audio_clip')                                          AS legacy_audio_artifacts;
-- Expect: new_audio_refs >= legacy_audio_artifacts. Otherwise the writer for the typed
-- table never landed — the reader will throw CapabilityDataMissingError in production.

-- Template C: no-orphan invariant (§1.7) executed via SQL (not just baked into HC code)
SELECT count(*) AS orphans
FROM indonesian.learning_capabilities c
LEFT JOIN indonesian.<typed_table> t ON t.capability_id = c.id
WHERE c.source_kind = '<source_kind>'
  AND c.retired_at IS NULL
  AND t.id IS NULL;
-- Expect: 0. Non-zero = caps exist whose data the reader needs but cannot find.
```

**The orchestrator's procedure on every PR's merge-to-main moment:**

1. Use the openbrain MCP (`mcp__openbrain__execute_sql`) to run the per-PR invariant queries.
2. Use `git show` + `git log --first-parent` against the merge commit to do Check 1.
3. If both checks pass → mark the PR done; dispatch the next PR's prompt.
4. If either check fails → do NOT dispatch the next PR. Either (a) fix-forward in the same PR (preferred), or (b) open a follow-up PR to complete the gap, blocking on the next source_kind until it lands.

**Per-PR invariant query lists.** Each PR section (§3–§10) names its specific invariant queries inline. The PR is not done until those queries return their expected values against the live DB after the merge. This is non-negotiable.

## §2. PR roadmap

| PR | Title | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PR 0** | Additive foundation: infra + typed table DDL + leaderboard retire + `?force_capability` bypass | — | ✅ shipped — typed-table DDL + typed-column projection live |
| **PR 1** | Item source_kind: writer + reader + re-publish | PR 0 | ✅ shipped — #87 item; #88 (§1.5 cap cleanup); §1.6 item-translation bridge |
| **PR 2** | Dialogue line source_kind: writer + reader + re-publish | PR 0 | ✅ shipped — #91 typed reader+writer+bridge; #92 validator → typed table + legacy artifact writes removed (see §5) |
| **PR 3** | Affixed form pair source_kind: writer + reader + re-publish | PR 0 | ✅ shipped — #94 typed reader+writer+validator+bridge; HC12 retired → HC17; renderContracts/catalog `affixed_form_pair → []` (see §6). No pattern_source_ref column exists (DDL deviates from §6.5) |

Admin path deferred to PR 4a. First live grammar render confirmed via DOM; bypass answer-commit blocked by pre-existing infra (issue #95, all source kinds) |
| **PR 5** | Retire the page-block render path: drop `lesson_page_blocks` (revised — **no** typed `lesson_blocks`; bespoke pages are the sole renderer) | PR 0 | implementing — branch `pr-5-retire-page-blocks`; runtime stack deleted + table dropped + RPC re-pointed; see §8 |
| **PR 6** | Lesson sections (Stage A): typed satellites + re-publish | PR 5 | not started |
| **PR 7** | Final cleanup: drop everything no longer read | PRs 1–6 | not started |

**Parallelism:** PRs 1–4 can start simultaneously after PR 0. PRs 5–6 are orthogonal to PRs 1–4. PR 7 waits for all.

---

## §3. PR 0 — Additive foundation

**Shape:** All work in PR 0 is additive or code-only. No drops; no data-loss risk. Safe to merge independently.

**6 commits already done on `pr-0-data-model-migration` branch (stand as-is):**
- `0570f59` — Extract `e2e/_helpers.ts`
- `8ab22f3` — `?force_capability` dev bypass
- `78620ba` — Add `learning_capabilities.prerequisite_keys`
- `2e4af28` — Add `learning_capabilities.required_artifacts`
- `f81bd53` — Switch projection to typed columns
- `9cda942` — Add `lesson_speakers` + redirect writers

**Remaining work in PR 0:**

### §3.1 Add all new typed satellite tables (additive DDL)

Add `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` blocks to `scripts/migration.sql` for every typed satellite introduced by PRs 1–4. Tables are empty until the per-PR re-publish populates them.

Tables to add (full DDL from `docs/plans/2026-05-21-data-model-target.md`):

**Item source_kind satellites:**
- `capability_audio_refs` — binds capabilities to audio clips (replaces audio_clip artifact rows)
- `recognition_mcq_distractors` — curated NL wrong-options per cap
- `cued_recall_distractors` — curated Indonesian wrong-options per cap
- `cloze_mcq_item_distractors` — curated filler-word strings per cap

**Dialogue line satellites:**
- `lesson_dialogue_lines` — typed per-line rows; FK to `lesson_sections`; `lesson_id` not null
- `dialogue_clozes` — one row per dialogue_line cap; `sentence_with_blank` + `answer_text`

**Affixed form pair satellite:**
- `affixed_form_pairs` — one row per capability (2 per linguistic pair); `root_text`, `derived_text`, `allomorph_rule`

**Pattern satellites:**
- `grammar_pattern_examples` — typed example sentences per grammar pattern
- `contrast_pair_exercises`
- `sentence_transformation_exercises`
- `constrained_translation_exercises`
- `cloze_mcq_exercises`

Every table gets: PK, FKs, FK indexes, RLS enabled, per-policy `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS; CREATE POLICY`, `GRANT SELECT TO authenticated`, `REVOKE INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE FROM authenticated`, `GRANT ALL TO service_role`, `COMMENT ON`.

### §3.2 Add `meaning_recall` + `cloze_mcq` to `exercise_type_availability`

```sql
insert into indonesian.exercise_type_availability
  (exercise_type, session_enabled, rollout_phase, created_at)
values
  ('meaning_recall', true, 'full', now()),
  ('cloze_mcq',      true, 'full', now())
on conflict (exercise_type) do nothing;
```

### §3.3 Retire the leaderboard (decision Q1)

```sql
drop view if exists indonesian.leaderboard;
```

Code-path removals in same PR:
- Delete `src/services/leaderboardService.ts`
- Delete `src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx`
- Delete `src/__tests__/leaderboardService.test.ts`
- Remove `/leaderboard` route from `src/App.tsx`
- Remove sidebar entry from `src/components/Sidebar.tsx:39`
- Delete `LeaderboardEntry` + `LeaderboardMetric` from `src/types/learning.ts:272-283`
- Remove leaderboard i18n keys from `src/lib/i18n.ts` (verify set via `git grep -n "leaderboard" src/lib/i18n.ts`)

No-missed-consumer gate: `git grep -niE 'leaderboard|LeaderboardEntry|LeaderboardMetric' src/` returns zero non-comment hits.

`scripts/migration.sql` co-edit: remove `create view indonesian.leaderboard ...` block + any GRANT on the view.

`learner_lesson_activation` is NOT dropped — still the canonical "lessons opted into" store.

### §3.4 Verify capability ID stability (done — §1.1)

`adapter.ts:116-146` confirms UUIDs stable on re-publish. No bridge step needed.

### §3.5 PR 0 gate

- `make migrate-idempotent-check` (applies `scripts/migration.sql` twice; second run must be clean)
- `make pre-deploy`
- Smoke: dashboard loads; no leaderboard nav; admin navigates to `/session?force_capability=<known-key>`; one card renders; answer it; `capability_review_events` gains the row.

**Writer/Reader/Validator triangle for PR 0:** No new content tables introduced with live readers. `lesson_speakers` (from commit `9cda942`) has: writer = `lesson-stage/audio.ts`; reader = `lesson-stage/audio.ts`; validator = DB PK `(lesson_id, speaker)`. All typed satellite tables added in §3.1 have no live readers yet — they become readers in PRs 1–4.

---

## §4. PR 1 — Item source_kind

**Target typed tables:** `learning_items.translation_nl/en/usage_note` (new columns), `capability_audio_refs`, `recognition_mcq_distractors`, `cued_recall_distractors`, `cloze_mcq_item_distractors`.

**Decision R:** `item_meanings` (1,248 rows) collapses into `learning_items.translation_nl` + `translation_en` + `usage_note`. Only NL + EN used in practice; no multi-sense per language.

### §4.1 DDL (additive)

```sql
-- Extend learning_items with translation columns.
alter table indonesian.learning_items
  add column if not exists translation_nl text,
  add column if not exists translation_en text,
  add column if not exists usage_note     text;
```

The `capability_audio_refs` and 3 distractor tables were added in PR 0 §3.1. No additional DDL here.

### §4.2 Pipeline writer

`scripts/lib/pipeline/capability-stage/projectors/vocab.ts`:
- Write `learning_items.translation_nl` + `translation_en` from staging items.
- Write `capability_audio_refs` rows (replaces artifact kind `audio_clip`).
- Write `recognition_mcq_distractors`, `cued_recall_distractors`, `cloze_mcq_item_distractors` from `vocab-enrichments.ts`.
- Remove `item_meanings` writes (table is retired at end of this PR — see cleanup below).
- Remove `capability_artifacts` writes for item-sourced kinds (`base_text`, `meaning:l1`, `accepted_answers:*`, `audio_clip`).

### §4.3 Pre-write validator

`scripts/lib/pipeline/capability-stage/validators/itemTranslations.ts`:
- Assert `translation_nl is not null` for every learning_items row. CRITICAL if not.
- Assert `distractors` arrays are non-empty for each distractor table row. CRITICAL if not.

### §4.4 Reader rewrite (fail-loud)

`src/lib/exercise-content/byKind/item.ts`:
- Read `learning_items.translation_<userLanguage>` directly (not `item_meanings`).
- Read `capability_audio_refs JOIN audio_clips` for audio resolution (not `artifactsByKind.get('audio_clip')`).
- Read `recognition_mcq_distractors` / `cued_recall_distractors` / `cloze_mcq_item_distractors` per exercise type.
- Throw `CapabilityDataMissingError` if `translation_nl` is null for a ready item cap.
- Remove all `fetchArtifacts` call sites for item-sourced artifact kinds.

Also update `src/lib/session-builder/adapter.ts` — the planner-side artifact reader for `validateCapability` — to read from `learning_items + translations + audio_refs` instead of `capability_artifacts` for item-sourced caps.

Coverage service co-edit: `src/services/coverageService.ts:76` reads `item_meanings` — switch to `learning_items.translation_nl is not null`.

### §4.5 Re-publish

```bash
for N in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do
  bun scripts/publish-approved-content.ts $N
done
```

This populates `learning_items.translation_nl/en`, `capability_audio_refs`, and distractor tables from staging. No SQL backfill.

### §4.6 Cleanup (same PR, after re-publish confirmed)

```sql
-- Drop item_meanings (Decision R — translations now on learning_items).
-- Confirm re-publish populated translation_nl for all items first.
drop table if exists indonesian.item_meanings cascade;
```

`scripts/migration.sql` co-edit: remove `CREATE TABLE indonesian.item_meanings ...` block + indexes + RLS + grants.

### §4.7 Gates

- G4: `SELECT count(*) FROM learning_items WHERE translation_nl IS NULL` = 0
- G4: `SELECT count(*) FROM capability_audio_refs` > 0
- G7: `?force_capability=item:masak.text_recognition` → answer → `capability_review_events` row with `source_kind='item'`
- No-orphan: every `learning_capabilities WHERE source_kind='item'` has `learning_items` + audio ref rows

**Writer/Reader/Validator triangle:**

| Table | Writer | Reader | Validator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `learning_items.translation_nl/en` | `projectors/vocab.ts` | `byKind/item.ts` | `validators/itemTranslations.ts` + DB (nullable until re-publish; NOT NULL added post-verify) |
| `capability_audio_refs` | `projectors/vocab.ts` | `byKind/item.ts` audio path | DB PK FK NOT NULL |
| `recognition_mcq_distractors` | `projectors/vocab.ts` | `byKind/item.ts` distractor path | DB `text[] not null` + validator |
| `cued_recall_distractors` | same | same | same |
| `cloze_mcq_item_distractors` | same | same | same |

**Rollback:** revert writer + reader code; re-publish restores the old shape. New tables are inert (additive). `item_meanings` drop is the irreversible step — archive before dropping.

## §5. PR 2 — Dialogue line source_kind

> **Status: ✅ shipped (2026-05-23).** #91 landed the typed reader + writer + bridge (§5.1–§5.3). #92 completed the slice end-to-end on the new design:
> - **renderContracts** — `dialogue_line` requires no artifacts (`[]`), mirroring `item` (Decision R). Readiness no longer consults `capability_artifacts`; structure is guaranteed by the `dialogue_clozes` NOT NULL columns + `validators/dialogueClozes.ts` + HC15.
> - **projector + runner** — stopped writing the legacy three `capability_artifacts` (`cloze_context`/`cloze_answer`/`translation:l1`); the typed `dialogue_clozes` row is the sole persisted representation.
> - **promote-capabilities.ts** — now projects from the typed columns + derives `skillType`, instead of the folded-away `metadata_json` it had still been reading. That stale read silently blocked promotion for *every* source_kind; fixing it is what let the dialogue caps promote.
> - **HC11 retired** in favour of HC15 (every dialogue_line cap has a `dialogue_clozes` row).
>
> Re-published L9: 7 `dialogue_clozes` rows; 7 caps `ready`/`published` with `required_artifacts=[]`; HC15 green; deployed (revision `0f88d0c`). The shared `capability_artifacts` table itself is retained for the not-yet-migrated kinds and drops in PR 7.

**Target typed tables:** `lesson_dialogue_lines`, `dialogue_clozes` (both added in PR 0 §3.1 — empty).

### §5.1 Pipeline writer

Stage A `lesson-stage/runner.ts`: write `lesson_dialogue_lines` rows (one per line in dialogue sections).

Stage B `projectors/dialogueArtifacts.ts`:
- Write `dialogue_clozes` typed rows (`sentence_with_blank`, `answer_text`).
- Remove `capability_artifacts` writes for dialogue kinds (`cloze_context`, `cloze_answer`, `translation:l1`).

### §5.2 Pre-write validators

`scripts/lib/pipeline/capability-stage/validators/dialogueCloze.ts`: `sentence_with_blank` contains exactly one blank marker; `answer_text` non-empty. CRITICAL if not.

`scripts/lib/pipeline/lesson-stage/validators/dialogueLines.ts`: every line in every dialogue section has `line_text` and `translation` non-empty. CRITICAL if not.

### §5.3 Reader rewrite (fail-loud)

`src/lib/exercise-content/byKind/dialogueLine.ts`:

```sql
SELECT dc.sentence_with_blank, dc.answer_text,
       dl.line_text, dl.speaker, dl.translation
FROM   indonesian.dialogue_clozes dc
JOIN   indonesian.lesson_dialogue_lines dl ON dl.id = dc.dialogue_line_id
WHERE  dc.capability_id = ANY($cap_ids)
```

Throw `CapabilityDataMissingError` if result is empty for a ready cap. Remove 3-artifact `fetchArtifacts` path.

Update `propagateDialogueTranslations.ts` to read from `lesson_dialogue_lines` instead of `lesson_sections.content.lines[]`.

### §5.4 Re-publish (L9 only — dialogue_line caps exist only there)

```bash
bun scripts/publish-approved-content.ts 9
```

### §5.5 Gates

- G4: `SELECT count(*) FROM dialogue_clozes` = 7
- G7: `?force_capability=<dialogue_line:L9/sec-X/line-Y.contextual_cloze>` → `capability_review_events` row with `source_kind='dialogue_line'`
- No-orphan: every `learning_capabilities WHERE source_kind='dialogue_line'` has a `dialogue_clozes` row

**Writer/Reader/Validator triangle:**

| Table | Writer | Reader | Validator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lesson_dialogue_lines` | `lesson-stage/runner.ts` | `byKind/dialogueLine.ts` JOIN | `validators/dialogueLines.ts` + DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE(section_id, line_index) |
| `dialogue_clozes` | `projectors/dialogueArtifacts.ts` | `byKind/dialogueLine.ts` | `validators/dialogueCloze.ts` + DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE on `capability_id` |

**Rollback:** revert writer + reader; re-publish. New typed rows become stale but cause no harm.

## §6. PR 3 — Affixed form pair source_kind

> **Status: ✅ shipped (2026-05-23, #94).** Typed reader + writer + validator (CS12) + one-shot bridge, on the same end-state design as dialogue_line:
> - **renderContracts + capabilityCatalog** — `affixed_form_pair` requires no artifacts (`[]`), mirroring item + dialogue_line (Decision R). This both stops the shared artifact builder from emitting `root_derived_pair`/`allomorph_rule` (it maps over `requiredArtifacts`) and moves readiness onto the `affixed_form_pairs` NOT NULL columns + `validateAffixedFormPairs` + HC17.
> - **HC12 retired** in favour of HC17 (every active affixed_form_pair cap has an `affixed_form_pairs` row).
> - **No promote-capabilities change** — PR 2's #92 already de-staled promotion globally (reads typed columns), so the 4 L9 caps were already `ready`/`published`, not stuck.
> - **DDL deviation from §6.5 below:** the shipped `affixed_form_pairs` table (`scripts/migration.sql:2420-2431`) has **no `pattern_source_ref` column** (PR 0 did not add it; staging's `patternSourceRef` is a source_ref, not a `grammar_patterns.slug`), and `allomorph_rule` is `NOT NULL`. So the §6.5 `pattern_source_ref` validator/reader/bridge and a pattern-link HC do not exist; HC17 (no-orphan) is the sole live invariant.
>
> Bridge applied: `affixed_form_pairs` 0 → 4. Re-published L9: `affixedFormPairs=4`; all 4 caps `ready`/`published` with `required_artifacts=[]`; HC17 green; reader-simulation 4/4 OK. The shared `capability_artifacts` table is retained for not-yet-migrated kinds (pattern) and drops in PR 7.

**Target typed table:** `affixed_form_pairs` (added in PR 0 §3.1 — empty).

### §6.1 Pipeline writer

`projectors/morphology.ts`:
- Write one `affixed_form_pairs` row per capability (2 per linguistic pair — one for recognition cap UUID, one for production cap UUID).
- Remove `capability_artifacts` writes for morphology kinds (`root_derived_pair`, `allomorph_rule`).

### §6.2 Pre-write validator

`scripts/lib/pipeline/capability-stage/validators/morphology.ts`: `root_text`, `derived_text`, `allomorph_rule` non-empty per row. CRITICAL if not.

### §6.3 Reader rewrite (fail-loud)

`src/lib/exercise-content/byKind/affixedFormPair.ts`:

```sql
SELECT afp.root_text, afp.derived_text, afp.allomorph_rule, lc.capability_type, lc.direction
FROM   indonesian.affixed_form_pairs afp
JOIN   indonesian.learning_capabilities lc ON lc.id = afp.capability_id
WHERE  afp.capability_id = ANY($cap_ids)
```

Throw `CapabilityDataMissingError` on empty result for a ready cap. The reader resolves direction from `lc.capability_type` (recognition vs production).

### §6.4 Re-publish (L9 only)

```bash
bun scripts/publish-approved-content.ts 9
```

### §6.5 Gates

- G4: `SELECT count(*) FROM affixed_form_pairs` = 4 (2 pairs × 2 caps)
- G7: `?force_capability=<affixed_form_pair cap key>` → `capability_review_events` with `source_kind='affixed_form_pair'`. First-ever live rendering of affixed_form_pair caps.
- No-orphan: every `learning_capabilities WHERE source_kind='affixed_form_pair'` has an `affixed_form_pairs` row

**Writer/Reader/Validator triangle:**

| Table | Writer | Reader | Validator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `affixed_form_pairs` | `projectors/morphology.ts` | `byKind/affixedFormPair.ts` | `validators/morphology.ts` + DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE(source_ref, capability_id) |

**Rollback:** revert writer + reader; re-publish.

## §7. PR 4 — Pattern source_kind

> **Status: ✅ shipped (2026-05-24).** First-ever live grammar rendering. The runtime path landed; corrections vs the prose below, forced by the live schema + how the code actually works:
> - **Writer is the capability-stage runner step 10** (`projectGrammar` → `insertGrammarExerciseTyped`), dual-writing the 4 typed tables alongside `exercise_variants` via the shared `projectors/grammarExerciseRows.ts` mapper. The 716 existing rows (all candidates already `published`, so re-publish/standalone-script don't regenerate them) were migrated by the one-shot bridge `scripts/migrate-typed-tables-pr4-grammar.ts` (idempotent on PK `id`; 0→141/189/240/146).
> - **The 4 tables are keyed by `grammar_pattern_id`, not `capability_id`** (no such column). Cap → exercise link: `source_ref` (`lesson-N/pattern-<slug>`) → strip prefix → `grammar_patterns.slug` → `grammar_pattern_id`. The reader (`byKind/pattern.ts`) collapses N rows per (pattern, exercise_type) → one (lowest id); selection/variety is a planner concern.
> - **Readiness moved off artifacts (Decision R mirror):** `capabilityCatalog` zeroes pattern `requiredArtifacts` so `validateCapability` returns ready on re-publish (this was NOT a no-op — caps declared `pattern_explanation:l1`/`pattern_example`). The legacy `variant` slot was removed from `RawProjectorInput` entirely (verified 0 `exercise_variants` attach to vocab items).
> - **`grammar_pattern_examples` left empty** (unwritten + unread — would be dead data; deferred to a future lesson-reader grammar-display feature). **`source_candidate_id` kept** unpopulated (audit m4; shipped DDL + spec).
> - **Validator** is per-table Zod (CS13, audit I2 — no shared options helper). **HCs** are HC19 (contrast no-orphan) + HC20 (recognition no-orphan), joined via slug (not `cpe.capability_id` — no such column).
> - **Admin path (exerciseReviewService / VariantPreview / ExerciseSummaryCard / ContentReview) deferred to PR 4a** — `exercise_variants` writes retained for it until then.
> - HC19 ✓ / HC20 ✓; reader-sim 4/4; first live grammar render confirmed via DOM. The `?force_capability` answer-commit (`rejected_invalid_outcome`) is a pre-existing bypass-infra bug affecting all source kinds — issue #95, not PR 4.

**Target typed tables:** `grammar_pattern_examples`, `contrast_pair_exercises`, `sentence_transformation_exercises`, `constrained_translation_exercises`, `cloze_mcq_exercises` (all added in PR 0 §3.1 — empty).

### §7.1 Pipeline writer

`projectors/grammar.ts`:
- Write `grammar_pattern_examples` typed rows.
- Remove `capability_artifacts` writes for pattern kinds (`pattern_explanation:l1`, `pattern_example`).

`scripts/publish-grammar-candidates.ts`:
- Write to the 4 typed exercise tables instead of `exercise_variants`.
- Remove `exercise_variants` write path.

### §7.2 Pre-write validator

`scripts/lib/pipeline/capability-stage/validators/grammarExercises.ts`:
- `prompt_text`, `correct_option_id`, `explanation_text` non-empty for `contrast_pair`. CRITICAL if not.
- `source_sentence`, `acceptable_answers` non-empty for `sentence_transformation`. CRITICAL if not.
- Similar per-type checks for `constrained_translation` + `cloze_mcq`.

### §7.3 Reader rewrite + routing widening (fail-loud)

**New `src/lib/exercise-content/byKind/pattern.ts`** — reads from the typed exercise table keyed on `capability_type`:
- `pattern_contrast` → `contrast_pair_exercises WHERE grammar_pattern_id = $pattern_id`
- `pattern_recognition` → `sentence_transformation_exercises` / `constrained_translation_exercises` / `cloze_mcq_exercises` (by `is_active` + lesson matching)
- Throw `CapabilityDataMissingError` on empty result.

**`src/lib/exercise-content/adapter.ts`** — add `pattern` bucket; wire into `Promise.all`.

**`src/lib/capabilities/renderContracts.ts` — routing widening (Decision G):**
- `contrast_pair`: `capabilityTypes: []` → `['pattern_contrast']`; `supportedSourceKinds` → `['pattern']`
- `sentence_transformation`: same pattern
- `constrained_translation`: same pattern
- `cloze_mcq`: add `'pattern_recognition'` to `capabilityTypes`; add `'pattern'` to `supportedSourceKinds`

**`ContractInputShapes` replacement (Decision M1):**

```ts
// OLD (retired exercise_variants):
contrast_pair: BuilderBase & { variant: ExerciseVariant }

// NEW (typed exercise table rows):
contrast_pair:              BuilderBase & { exercise: ContrastPairExercisesRow }
sentence_transformation:    BuilderBase & { exercise: SentenceTransformationExercisesRow }
constrained_translation:    BuilderBase & { exercise: ConstrainedTranslationExercisesRow }
cloze_mcq:                  BuilderBase & { exercise: ClozeMcqExercisesRow }
```

`byType/{contrastPair,sentenceTransformation,constrainedTranslation,clozeMcq}.ts`: switch from `input.variant.payload_json.X` to `input.exercise.X` (typed column access).

**Admin path rewrite (decision Q5 — same PR):**
- `src/services/exerciseReviewService.ts` — switch from `exercise_variants` to per-type reads from the 4 typed tables.
- `src/pages/ContentReview.tsx` + `src/components/admin/VariantPreview.tsx` + `ExerciseSummaryCard.tsx` — `switch (row.exercise_type)` dispatch on typed rows; remove JSON probing.
- `src/services/coverageService.ts:78` — switch from `exercise_variants` to per-typed-table counts.
- `src/types/learning.ts` — delete `ExerciseVariant` type.

No-missed-consumer gate: `git grep -n "variant\.payload_json\|ExerciseVariant\b" src/` returns zero hits.

### §7.4 Re-publish (all lessons)

```bash
for N in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do
  bun scripts/publish-approved-content.ts $N
done
```

### §7.5 Gates

- G4: `SELECT count(*) FROM grammar_pattern_examples` ≥ 47; `count(*) FROM contrast_pair_exercises` ≥ 141
- G7: 4 sub-checks — one per grammar exercise type, each confirming `capability_review_events` row with `source_kind='pattern'`. First-ever live rendering of pattern caps.
- No-orphan: every `learning_capabilities WHERE source_kind='pattern'` has at least one row in one of the 4 exercise tables

**Writer/Reader/Validator triangle:**

| Table | Writer | Reader | Validator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grammar_pattern_examples` | `projectors/grammar.ts` | `byKind/pattern.ts` | `validators/grammarExercises.ts` + DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE |
| `contrast_pair_exercises` | `publish-grammar-candidates.ts` | `byType/contrastPair.ts` | DB CHECK on `options` + validator |
| `sentence_transformation_exercises` | same | `byType/sentenceTransformation.ts` | DB NOT NULL + validator |
| `constrained_translation_exercises` | same | `byType/constrainedTranslation.ts` | DB NOT NULL + validator |
| `cloze_mcq_exercises` | same | `byType/clozeMcq.ts` | DB CHECK on `options` + validator |

**Rollback:** revert `renderContracts.ts` routing (grammar exercises go inert — `capabilityTypes: []`). Revert `byType/*.ts` to `input.variant.payload_json.X`. Revert admin service. Re-publish restores `exercise_variants` rows if the old write path is restored. The routing revert is the highest-risk step; inert grammar exercises are the safe failure mode.

## §8. PR 5 — Retire the page-block render path

> **Scope revised 2026-05-25 — retirement, not typed migration.** The original §8

> was dropped after grounding against the shipped code. The page-block path was

> no typed replacement.

**End state:** one lesson-rendering path (bespoke pages); zero page-block
machinery. DB lesson content (`lesson_sections` + PR 6 typed children) exists
purely as the capability contract + coverage/propagation reads, never for page
rendering.

### §8.1 Removed (runtime)
- `src/pages/Lesson.tsx` (generic reader page) + `__tests__/Lesson.test.tsx`
- `src/components/lessons/LessonReader.tsx` (+ `.module.css`) + `__tests__/LessonReader.test.tsx`
- `src/components/lessons/blocks/LessonBlockRenderer.tsx`
- `src/lib/lessons/experience.ts` (`buildLessonExperience`) + its test
- `src/lib/preview/localPreviewContent.ts` (synthetic preview model)
- `getLessonPageBlocks`, the `LessonPageBlock` type, and the `source_refs`-based
  `getLessonCapabilityPracticeSummary` variant (`lib/lessons` adapter + barrel)

### §8.2 Re-pointed (runtime)
- `LessonRouter.tsx` — dropped the `<Lesson/>` fallback; an unregistered UUID is a not-found case.
- `LocalPreview.tsx` — renders the real bespoke pages from `content.json` (via `registry.tsx`), not the synthetic page-block model.
- `Session.tsx` — `lesson_practice`/`lesson_review` scope from `learning_capabilities.lesson_id` (`getLessonSourceRefsByLessonId`), not page-block fan-out. **Session-builder unchanged** — same `selectedSourceRefs.includes(cap.sourceRef)` match, new data source (adjacent-module rule).
- `Lessons.tsx` + `registry.tsx` — `preparedLessonIds` ("openable" tile gate) from bespoke-registry membership (`bespokeLessonIdSet`), replacing the retired `has_page_blocks` RPC signal. "Openable" is a client fact (has a bespoke page), not a DB one.

### §8.3 DB + pipeline + health (`migration.sql`, `check-supabase-deep.ts`, lesson-stage)
- `drop table lesson_page_blocks cascade`; removed its `block_kind` widen-narrow block, the `source_refs` GIN index, the two column-drop DO blocks, and the historical lesson_id page-block backfill (lesson_id is pipeline-maintained per ADR 0006).
- Rewrote `get_lessons_overview` to drop the `lesson_block_presence` CTE + `has_page_blocks` column.
- Retired HC2 (`check-supabase-deep.ts`).
- Lesson-stage: the Stage A page-block writer was already gone (Phase 1, PR #85); PR 5 dropped the residual docstring steps.

### §8.4 Gates (met)
- Build green; lint 0 errors; 1232 tests pass.
- `make migrate-idempotent-check` green; `make migrate` applied to live DB.
- **Live-DB verified:** `lesson_page_blocks` absent (table not in schema cache); `get_lessons_overview` returns 9 rows with the new shape (`ready_capability_count` present, `has_page_blocks` absent).
- Visual smoke (pre-merge): all 9 bespoke lessons render; `/preview` renders bespoke pages; Lessons tiles openable for all registered lessons; unregistered `/lesson/:id` → not-found.

**Rollback:** revert the runtime + RPC commits. No re-publish needed (no content regenerated). The table drop is the one destructive step; the live DB is backed up daily (ADR 0011) for point-in-time recovery.

## §9. PR 6 — Lesson sections (Stage A, depends on PR 5)

**Target:** Add typed columns on `lesson_sections` + 5 child tables **alongside the retained `content jsonb` blob** (the blob is kept — see §9.1 / §10.2). `lesson_dialogue_lines` already exists from PR 2.

**These typed tables are dual-purpose (ADR 0011):** the lesson reader's structured source *and* the **capability-stage contract** — so they carry the fields the Capability Stage needs (stable item identity + all three languages), not just what the renderer reads. PR 6 establishes them; the capability-stage redesign (#98/#99) consumes them.

**New columns on `lesson_sections`:** `section_kind`, `source_section_ref`, `intro`, `paragraphs text[]`, `word_order`, `note`, `setup`, `closing`, `table_title`, `reference_payload jsonb`. Per-discriminator CHECK enforcing field applicability. (`content jsonb` is retained, not replaced.)

**New child tables (additive DDL — all carry `lesson_id`):**
- `lesson_section_item_rows` — per vocab/expression/number item: `source_item_ref` (stable capability identity), `item_type` (word/phrase/sentence), `indonesian_text`, `l1_translation` (Dutch, from the book), `l2_translation` (English, **generated by the Lesson Stage** — lesson material, not in the book)
- `lesson_section_grammar_categories`
- `lesson_section_grammar_topics`
- `lesson_section_pronunciation_letters`
- `lesson_section_exercise_groups`

### §9.1 Pipeline writer

`lesson-stage/runner.ts`:
- Write typed columns on `lesson_sections` and rows in child tables.
- Write `lesson_section_item_rows` with `source_item_ref` + `item_type` + `indonesian_text` + `l1_translation`.
- **Generate `l2_translation` (English) here** (decision 2026-05-25): English vocab meanings are *lesson material*, so the Lesson Stage produces them. Relocate the EN enricher out of `capability-stage/enrichEnTranslations.ts` into a lesson-stage enricher that fills `l2_translation` (and the `content` blob). The Capability Stage stops generating translations entirely — it reads ID/NL/EN from these rows.
- Keep writing `lesson_sections.content jsonb` **permanently** (decision 2026-05-25). The blob is **retained next to** the typed columns + child tables as the complete lesson-content snapshot — it is NOT dropped in PR 7. The typed structures are the projection that readers and the capability-stage contract (ADR 0011) use; the blob stays alongside them. This is a permanent dual-representation, not a temporary dual-write.

`lesson-stage/validators/sectionShape.ts`: assert per-`section_kind` field applicability; for item rows assert `source_item_ref`, `item_type`, `indonesian_text`, `l1_translation`, and `l2_translation` non-null. CRITICAL if not. (The `l2_translation` non-null gate mirrors PR 1's `translation_en` enforcement — now owned by Stage A.)

### §9.2 Reader rewrite (fail-loud)

`src/lib/lessons/adapter.ts:194,205`: consume typed columns + JOIN to child tables.

Per-lesson `Page.tsx` files (all 9 — `src/pages/lessons/lesson-N/Page.tsx`): rewrite from `section.content as <Shape>` to typed column access. These are second readers; they must be updated in the same PR.

`src/services/coverageService.ts`: switch from `lesson_sections.content` reads to typed-column reads.

No-missed-consumer gate: `git grep -n "section\.content as \|as LessonSection" src/pages/lessons/` returns zero hits.

**Downstream reader (post-PR-6, the reason these tables carry capability fields):** the typed lesson-content tables are the **capability-stage contract** (ADR 0011). The capability-stage redesign (#98/#99) reads `lesson_section_item_rows` (+ `lesson_dialogue_lines`) as its item source, replacing today's staging-file reads (`learning-items.ts`). Not a PR 6 code change — PR 6 establishes the tables; #98/#99 consume them — but it is why PR 6 must carry `source_item_ref`, `item_type`, and `l2_translation`.

### §9.3 Re-publish (all lessons)

```bash
for N in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do
  bun scripts/publish-approved-content.ts $N
done
```

### §9.4 Gates

- G4: child tables populated for all 9 lessons
- Visual smoke: all 9 lessons render all section kinds
- `check-supabase-deep`: no orphan child rows

**Writer/Reader/Validator triangle:**

| Table | Writer | Reader | Validator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lesson_sections` (new columns) | `lesson-stage/runner.ts` | `adapter.ts` + per-lesson `Page.tsx` × 9 | DB CHECK (per-discriminator) + `validators/sectionShape.ts` |
| `lesson_section_item_rows` | `lesson-stage/runner.ts` + EN enricher | per-lesson `Page.tsx` × 9 + `coverageService.ts` + **capability-stage (post-PR-6, #98/#99)** | DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE(section_id, display_order) + UNIQUE(lesson_id, source_item_ref) + `sectionShape.ts` (`l2_translation` + `source_item_ref` non-null) |
| `lesson_section_grammar_categories` | same | same | DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE + jsonb array CHECK |
| `lesson_section_grammar_topics` | same | same | DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE(section_id, topic_label) |
| `lesson_section_pronunciation_letters` | same | same | DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE(section_id, display_order) |
| `lesson_section_exercise_groups` | same | same | DB NOT NULL + UNIQUE(section_id, display_order) |

**Rollback:** revert writer + reader; re-publish with old writer. `lesson_sections.content` is restored on re-publish if the writer kept writing it.

---

## §10. PR 7 — Final cleanup

**Prerequisite:** PRs 1–6 all merged and re-publishes confirmed. Every reader has switched to typed tables. This is the one destructive PR.

**Pre-drop checklist (run before each drop, in order):**

```bash
# 1. Confirm zero readers for each thing being dropped.
grep -rn 'capability_artifacts'  src/ scripts/lib/   # must be zero non-comment hits
grep -rn 'item_meanings'         src/ scripts/lib/   # must be zero (dropped in PR 1)
grep -rn 'exercise_variants'     src/ scripts/lib/   # must be zero (dropped in PR 4)
grep -rn 'section\.content'      src/               # must be zero
# (lesson_page_blocks already dropped in PR 5 — table + all readers gone.)

# 2. Confirm row counts (should all be 0 after re-publishes stopped writing them).
SELECT count(*) FROM indonesian.capability_artifacts;
SELECT count(*) FROM indonesian.exercise_variants;
```

### §10.1 Drop content tables (now fully superseded)

```sql
drop table if exists indonesian.capability_artifacts cascade;
drop table if exists indonesian.exercise_variants    cascade;
-- lesson_page_blocks was already dropped in PR 5 (page-block render path retired).
```

`scripts/migration.sql` co-edits: remove `CREATE TABLE` blocks + indexes + RLS + grants for the two remaining tables.

### §10.2 Retain lesson_sections.content column (NOT dropped — decision 2026-05-25)

The `lesson_sections.content` blob is **kept permanently** alongside the typed columns + child tables. It is the complete, round-trippable lesson-content snapshot; the typed structures are its projection (and the capability-stage contract per ADR 0011). **No drop here** — the earlier `alter table ... drop column content` step is removed.

Runtime readers still move to the typed columns in PR 6 (the blob is retained as data, not as a read path), so the `section.content` reader-count check below still applies; the difference is the column itself survives.

### §10.3 Drop legacy-retained user-state tables (no live readers since 2026-05-01)

Archive to `/Users/albert/home/learning-indonesian-archive/legacy-state-<date>.sql.gz` before dropping.

```sql
drop table if exists indonesian.learner_item_state   cascade;
drop table if exists indonesian.learner_skill_state  cascade;
drop table if exists indonesian.review_events        cascade;
drop table if exists indonesian.lesson_progress      cascade;
```

`scripts/migration.sql` co-edits: remove CREATE + indexes + RLS + grants for all four.

### §10.4 Drop empty / aspirational tables

```sql
drop table if exists indonesian.item_context_grammar_patterns   cascade;
drop table if exists indonesian.generated_exercise_candidates   cascade;
drop table if exists indonesian.textbook_pages                  cascade;
drop table if exists indonesian.textbook_sources                cascade;
```

### §10.5 RPC body co-edits

**`get_lessons_overview`** (`scripts/migration.sql` — the body reads `lesson_progress` and `lessons.duration_seconds`, both dropped):

```sql
drop function if exists indonesian.get_lessons_overview(uuid) cascade;
create function indonesian.get_lessons_overview(p_user_id uuid)
returns table (
  id uuid, lesson_number int, title text, summary text,
  has_started_lesson boolean
) language sql stable security invoker as $$
  select
    l.id, l.lesson_number, l.title, l.summary,
    exists (
      select 1 from indonesian.learner_lesson_activation lla
       where lla.user_id = p_user_id and lla.lesson_id = l.id
    ) as has_started_lesson
  from indonesian.lessons l
  order by l.lesson_number;
$$;
```

`src/pages/Lessons.tsx`: remove `duration_seconds` assignment from RPC row mapping.

**`commit_capability_answer_report`** — if `fsrs_state_json` on `learner_capability_state` was not already dropped earlier, drop it here:

```sql
alter table indonesian.learner_capability_state
  drop column if exists fsrs_state_json;
```

Then drop + recreate the RPC body without the `fsrs_state_json` UPDATE.

**`capability_review_events` column renames** (idempotent DO block):

```sql
do $$ begin
  if exists (select 1 from information_schema.columns
    where table_schema='indonesian' and table_name='capability_review_events'
      and column_name='answer_report_json') then
    alter table indonesian.capability_review_events rename column answer_report_json to answer_report;
  end if;
  -- same pattern for state_before_json → state_before, state_after_json → state_after
end $$;
```

Drop `scheduler_snapshot_json` + `artifact_version_snapshot_json` from `capability_review_events`.

Recreate `commit_capability_answer_report` RPC body referencing the renamed columns.

### §10.6 Drop dead code

- `src/lib/capabilities/artifactRegistry.ts` — delete (no consumers)
- `src/lib/exercise-content/adapter.ts:291-303` (`fetchArtifacts`) — delete function (no callers)
- `src/lib/session-builder/adapter.ts:282-289` — remove planner-side artifact reader
- `src/types/learning.ts` — `ArtifactKind`, `ArtifactIndex`, `CapabilityArtifact` types → delete

### §10.7 Gate

- `make migrate-idempotent-check`
- `make pre-deploy`
- `make check-supabase-deep`
- G7 regression check: one force-bypass run per source_kind (item, dialogue_line, affixed_form_pair, pattern) — all 4 must land `capability_review_events` rows

**Rollback for PR 7:** This is the one PR with no cheap rollback. Dropped tables require pg_dump restoration. The risk is managed by:
1. Running the pre-drop grep checklist above (confirms zero live readers before dropping).
2. Taking `pg_dump --schema=indonesian` before this PR runs.
3. The G7 regression checks immediately after migration confirm all 4 source_kinds still work.

## §11. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Grammar exercise routing widening (PR 4) — first-ever live pattern caps | HIGH | `exercise_type_availability.session_enabled = false` for grammar types; flip to `true` after G7 verified |
| Lesson reader rewrite (PR 5) — fuzzy → typed; any missed section shape throws | HIGH | Visual smoke all 9 lessons in dev before merge |
| `lesson_sections` reader switch (PR 6) — 9 per-lesson Page.tsx files move to typed columns | MEDIUM | No-missed-consumer grep gate before §9.4. The `content` blob is **retained** (not dropped — decision 2026-05-25), so a missed reader still has its data to fall back on — downgrades this from HIGH |
| PR 7 drops — no cheap rollback | HIGH | pg_dump before PR 7; pre-drop grep checklist; immediate G7 regression |
| Edge function deploy gap (PR 7 RPC rename) | LOW | At 2-user scale acceptable; force-bypass check closes the window |

## §12. What this plan does NOT cover

- **Podcast source_kinds** (`podcast_segment`, `podcast_phrase`) — zero DB rows; feature ships post-migration. Typed schema is a separate workstream.
- **`podcasts` table** — unchanged per decision Q2. Feature ships after this migration.
- **Speaking exercise table** — `capabilityTypes: []`; no caps route to it. Add `speaking_exercises` when speaking becomes live.
- **Audio storage hygiene** — 1,334 unreferenced `audio_clips` rows. Separate pass after PR 1.
- **Module spec updates** — every PR that touches a module surface must update `docs/current-system/modules/<name>.md` same-commit (CLAUDE.md rule). Per-PR code-path sections imply which specs need updating.
- **Subagent prompt updates** — grammar-exercise-creator prompt in PR 4; vocab-exercise-creator prompt in PR 1.

**End of migration plan.**
